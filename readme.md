Readme

This is just to make some example schemas for the project. The final version will be a single file that contains all the schemas (should we continue in this direction). I have them in separate files so it is easier for me to work on them.

basic_card.xsd - Define the general data structure of a card
form.xsd - Define elements of a form
http.xsd - Define http request (need to add behavior condition)
text.xsd - Define text block | Thinking of changing to content block
