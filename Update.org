#+TITLE: Card Updates
#+AUTHOR: Devin M. O'Brien

* Document
** Purpose
This document is to help keep track of development as we move
forward. Everything in the overview will essentially be the same so
you can move to [[Todo]] for information on what is actually going on.

*** Personal Note
I may not always be available, I have projects in other classes so I
can't always meet up so I am better suited documenting things
out. That doesn't mean that you can not, but I would like to have this
available so in situations where I am not able to be reached, there
some information to explain what everything is and what is going on
without my real-time feedback; hope that makes some sense.


** Conventions
*** Org-Mode
This document is a plain text file that uses [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] which is, on a
basic level, a schema that is similar to markdown. In truth, that
doesn't give it justice since its implementation is more powerful than
any markdown implementation that I have seen.
 
**** Viewing
When viewing this document you will typically see one of two versions
of this document:
- A Parsed Version: There will be some information that is missing and
  the formatting may look weird. Most information will be available,
  but some conventions like =drawers= may not show up. In this case,
  it is typically possible to view the raw file (See Below)

- The Full Text Version: This is what this document actually looks
  like. While I am using Org-Mode (which is essentially a version
  above), it saves the document in a text format that is readable in
  *any* text editor. Some features like folding may not be available
  which is important.


*** Emacs
I am using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] to edit the the document. Emacs is a powerful
text-editor which does translate to it being difficult to use so I
don't expect anyone else to use it. If you would like me to describe
the problems with it, I can add a list, but otherwise I will leave
that open-ended.
*** Task Management
With [[Org-Mode]], I have implemented some task management.

* Todo
** Description
This will contain two types of items, things that have been completed
and what needs to be done.
