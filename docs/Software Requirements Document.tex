\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Features}


\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsection{Operating Enviornment}
This software is intended to be used in a professional environment.
\paragraph[draft=true]{What is a professional Environment?}
\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}

This software is required to be implemented in Java. 
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Primary Functions}
Primary functions are those that will always be available.
\subsection{Secondary Functions}
Secondary functions are those that may not always be available.
\section{Technical Requirements}
\subsection{Operating Systems/Compatibility}

This software will use libraries that are cross-platform to some extent
to be allowed to work on operating systems that run JRE 8.

\subsection{Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interface}\label{user-interface}

The User Interface must not be cluttered, and needs to be intuitive.

\subsubsection{ Hardware Interface}
The software will not require any special hardware interfaces beyond what is required of a standard Java Desktop Application which includes but not limited to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Monitor
\item CPU w/ multithreading capabilities
\item RAM
\item Storage Device
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ Software Interface}
This software will require \acrshort{jre} 8, and some graphical service (like Xorg on linux).
\subsubsection{Communications Interface}
This software will use an API on a remote service to \ldots
\section{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Safety/Recovery Requirements}

The software will have the following features to protect the user data: (1) Backup saving system to prevent primary file from being corrupted due to premature shutdown. (2) Autosaving sytem to save userdata a change has been made. 

\subsection{Security Requirments}
The software would normally have security requirements to protect its users. However for this project, it is beyond its scope and will not be worked on. 

\subsection{Policy Requirements}

\subsection{Software Quality Attributes}

\subsubsection{Availability}
This software will have the following feature(s) that will become unavailable without Internet access:
\begin{itemize}
\item Google Calendar (Syncing)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Correctness}
This software will strive to ensure that data is properly saved to prevent loss of the aforementioned data.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
This software will strive to follow the standards for object oriented programming to make it easier to maintain the software.

\subsubsection{Reusability}
 This software will strive to follow the standards for object oriented programming. 
\subsubsection{Portability }
Thissoftware will strive to work cross-platform. 

\subsection{Process Requirements}

\subsubsection{Development Process Used}}

This project plans to use a waterdown development process.
\subsubsection{Time Constraints}
There are no time constraints except for the delivery date.
\subsubsection{ Cost and Delivery Date}
 The delivery date for the project is
\textbf{\emph{December 1, 2020}}.
