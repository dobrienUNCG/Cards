\subsection{Purpose}

This Software Requirements Document is for the CSC 429-01 Software
Engineering semester project. This document will cover the requirements
that are imposed by the project and the expectations of the software.


\subsection{Document Conventions}This document will define 

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This SRD is intended for Professor Ike. 

\subsection{Definitions/Jargon}
SRD : Software Requirements Document

JRE : Java Runtime Environment

JDK : Java Development Environment

JVM : Java Virtual Machine 

\subsection{Project Scope}

\section{Overall Description}\label{overall-description}

\subsection{Product Features}\label{product-features}


\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsection{Operating Enviornment}\label{operating-enviornment}

\subsection{Design and Implementation
Constraints}\label{design-and-implementation-constraints}

This software is required to be implemented in Java. 
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\section{Functional Requirements}\label{functional-requirements}

\subsection{Primary Functions}\label{primary-functions}

\subsection{Secondary Functions}\label{secondary-functions}

\section{Technical Requirements}\label{technical-requirements}

\subsection{Operating
Systems/Compatibility}\label{operating-systemscompatibility}

This software will use libraries that are cross-platform to some extent
to be allowed to work on operating systems that run JRE 8. \#\#
Interface Requirements

\subsubsection{User Interface}\label{user-interface}

The User Interface must not be cluttered, and needs to be intuitive.

\subsubsection{ Hardware Interface} The software will not require any special
hardware interfaces beyond what is required of a standard Java Desktop
Application. 
\subsubsection{ Software Interface}

\subsubsection{Communications Interface}\label{communications-interface}

This software will use an API on a remote service to \ldots{} \#
Nonfunctional Requirements

\subsection{Performance Requirements}\label{performance-requirements}

\subsection{Safety/Recovery
Requirements}\label{safetyrecovery-requirements}

The software will have the following features to protect the user data:
(1) Backup saving system to prevent primary file from being corrupted
due to premature shutdown. (2) Autosaving sytem to save userdata a
change has been made. 

\subsection{Security Requirments} The software would
normally have security requirements to protect its users. However for
this project, it is beyond its scope and will not be worked on. 

\subsection{Policy Requirements}

\subsection{Software Quality
Attributes}\label{software-quality-attributes}

\subsubsection{Availability}\label{availability}

This software will have features that will not be available without
internet access. 
\subsubsection{Correctness} This software will strive to ensure
that data is properly saved to prevent loss of the aforementioned data.
\subsubsection{Maintainability} This software will strive to follow the standards
for object oriented programming to make it easier to maintain the
software. 
\subsubsection{Reusability}
 This software will strive to follow the standards for object oriented programming. 
\subsubsection{Portability }
Thissoftware will strive to work cross-platform. 

\subsection{Process Requirements}

\subsubsection{Development Process Used}\label{development-process-used}

This project plans to use a waterdown development process. \#\#\# Time
Constraints There are no time constraints except for the delivery date.
\subsubsection{ Cost and Delivery Date}
 The delivery date for the project is
\textbf{\emph{December 1, 2020}}.
