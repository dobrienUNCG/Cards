<section title="Card A">
I need to do <span class="event"><span date="2018-12-30T19:34:50.63">something</span> at 8pm</span>
</section>
<section title="Card B">
This is an example of a card? Lets see how this works!.

</section>
<section title="Card C">
This card is in an HTML Document with other cards! 

</section>
<section title="Card D">
Each card is essentially a section block in the document.
</section>
<section title="Card E">
Events scanning has not been implemented (or syncronous date creation), but a schema has been worked on!.
</section>
<section title="Card F">
An event is comprised of two span tags for style purposes. The first tag will be around the entire detected statement, and the second tag will be around a parsed version. 

This can be combined into a single span tag.
</section>
<section title="Card G">
The test cases that I am thinking of using will be different versions of this detection system and comparing the output of what has been found to what is desired.
