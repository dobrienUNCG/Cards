  <h1>Testing</h1> 
  <p>This is a test for rich-text using HTML.</p> 
  <p>Currently I can save and load from a HTML file. There are currently the following problems:</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>No Backups (And is very fragile)</li> 
   <li>Only have it set to a specific file</li> 
   <li>Keeps old body in memory and will use it when reloading the file without closing the application.</li> 
   <ul> 
    <li>A file that has been saved is not overwritten when loaded.</li> 
    <li>However if a file is loaded and saved; the file is overwritten</li> 
   </ul> 
   <li>Haven't added checking for special syntax.</li> 
   <li>Need to seperate IO</li> 
   <li>This is just a demo</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Started seperating HTMLModel</p><p>Update:</p><p>I got loading files somewhat working (still need to break into different classes) however saving is still not working</p>
